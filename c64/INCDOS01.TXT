Welcome to Project 64!

  The goal of Project 64 is to preserve Commodore 64 related documents
in electronic text format that might otherwise cease to exist with the
rapid advancement of computer technology and declining interest in 8-
bit computers on the part of the general population.

  Extensive efforts were made to preserve the contents of the original
document.  However, certain portions, such as diagrams, program
listings, and indexes may have been either altered or sacrificed due
to the limitations of plain vanilla text.  Diagrams may have been
eliminated where ASCII-art was not feasible.  Program listings may be
missing display codes where substitutions were not possible.  Tables
of contents and indexes may have been changed from page number
references to section number references. Please accept our apologies
for these limitations, alterations, and possible omissions.

  The author(s) of the original document and members of Project 64 make
no representations about the accuracy or suitability of this material
for any purpose.  This etext is provided "as-is".  Please refer to the
warantee of the original document, if any, that may included in this
etext.  No other warantees, express or implied, are made to you as to
the etext or any medium it may be on.  Neither the author(s) nor the
members of Project 64 will assume liability for damages either from
the direct or indirect use of this etext or from the distribution of
or modification to this etext.  Therefore if you read this document or
use the information herein you do so at your own risk.

                        ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

A manual like this one would not be possible without a great deal of technical
assistance. Mike Todd's Disk File column in the ICPUG Newsletter proved to be
an invaluable source of insight into the inner workings of Commodore's DOS.
Raeto West's book, Programming the PET/CBM, was a constant companion. Jim
Butterfield's numerous articles also provided valuable bits and pieces of
information. Brad Templeton's POWER™ system and PAL™ assembler made the
development of the programs in this manual a real joy. These packages are
commercially available from Professional Software Inc. In addition, both the
PAL disassembler and MICROMON were used as tools for disassembling the 1541 DOS.

We would also like to acknowledge the patience and forebearance of our families
and friends. Without their support, producing this manual would have been
considerably more difficult. Mike Louder of DATAMOST, Inc. also provided
tremendous support for its production.

Finally, we would like to extend a special note of thanks to Dr. Tom MacNeil
and Nancy Neufeld for their diligent work in proofreading this manual.

This manual was written on a Commodore computer system using the WordPro 4 Plus
word processing system. The WordPro Plus™ Series is commercially available from
Professional Software Inc. This sophisticated word processing system made
editing and last minute revisions much easier.
