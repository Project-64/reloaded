- I -  PREFACE

The SUPER EXPANDER 64 is a powerful extension of the BASIC language in the 
computer Commodore 64.  In precedence it was necessary to treat with Peek or 
Poke the specific locations of memory for have agreed to the graphic and 
resounding characteristics of the computer.  Currently the SUPER EXPANDER 64 
furnishes new BASIC commands, that allow to approach easily to the many 
characteristics of the Commodore 64.  You must only "insert" the SUPER 
EXPANDER 64 cartridge and power on the computer.  With SUPER EXPADER 64 is 
possible:

-	create graphic visualizations in high resolution;
-	create and animate "sprites" (graphic images);
-	draw forms and imagery you desire;
-	draw points, lines, arcs, circles and ellipsis;
-	draw polygons, for example rectangles, triangles, octagons;
-	combine texts and graphic in high resolution;
-	fill imagery with colors you choice;
- 	"read" positions of paddles and joystick for games and optic pen;
-	create music and sounds for games;
-	define programmable function keys .

Best part of the actions of executable BASIC planning with the SUPER 
EXPANDER 64, could be performed also with the only BASIC but, when comes used 
the SUPER EXPANDER 64,  programs result generally more compact, they come 
performed very more quickly and more easy from develop: additionally the 
SUPER EXPANDER 64 consents to realize many actions that they couldn't be 
effect using BASIC only.
This handbook has destined to readership already in possession of some 
notions of BASIC programming and to acquaintance of the many characteristics 
of the Commodore 64.  Commands and functions of the SUPER  EXPANDER 64 are 
explained and equipped with specific programs.  For subsequent informations 
concern to matters treated in the present handbook consult the "Handbook of 
the Commodore 64 user" and the "Handbook of the Commodore 64 Programmer".
We are sure that you will find enjoy using SUPER EXPANDER 64 cartridge with 
the its many graphic and sound characteristics.  Also readers with "artistic"
or "musical" modest preparation will be able to easily insert in the own 
educational programs, of work and relaxation, bright graphics,  colored, 
animate and various sounds.



- II -  CONVENTIONS FOR USE

Here below there is a brief list of some keys and symbols, and their use in 
the manual of the SUPER EXPANDER 64.  This will also be of help to interpret 
the syntax of the commands and functions, optional characteristics of them 
included.

RETURN	To continue a program after the introduction of a line, press 
		the RETURN key.

SHIFT		To insert a capital letter , hold pressed the "SHIFT" key  
		together with the desired key.  Both keys should be left at 
		the same time.

C=		This symbol represents the "Commodore" key  situated in the 
		angle in lower part to left of the Commodore 64 keyboard 
		(beside of the SHIFT key).

<>		The angle parentheses indicate that the parameter into them is 
		the requested information.  However, the same parameter could be 
		of varying nature.

[]		The square parentheses indicate that the parameter into them is 
		optional and can be omitted from the command syntax.

...		Some consecutive points, "ellipsis", specify to repeat the 
		preceding optional parameter.

A command is a word key that could locate from only or have followed from one 
or more indicators.  Each of these parameters is separate by a pointing sign,
for example with a comma (,), a semicolon (;), a sign of "number" (#) or a 
space.
A function is a word key continued immediately with parenthesis that contains 
one or two matters.  For more explanations about commands and  functions, see 
the "Programmer's reference guide" for the Commodore 64.

- 1 -  STARTING

The SUPER EXPANDER 64 is a program on cartridge that furnishes 11 embedded 
functions and 21 additional commands to the BASIC language of the Commodore 
64.  Follow these simple denotations for start the SUPER EXPANDER 64 program:

- Power off the computer (the computer ALWAYS goes down when you insert or 
  get away the  cartridge).

- Install the SUPER EXPANDER 64 cartridge with the label turned to high.  The 
  open side must be turned toward who insert it.

- Insert the SUPER EXPANDER 64 cartridge in the expansion port, situated to 
  left hand and under the power on led of the computer.

- Power on the computer.

It is now possible start to insert SUPER EXPANDER 64 commands directly from 
keyboard  (DIRECT mode) or embed these additional commands in the BASIC 
programs (PROGRAM mode).  In the DIRECT mode, insert simply the commands and 
press RETURN for a direct execution.  In the PROGRAM mode, the additional 
SUPER EXPANDER 64 commands  are inserted in the BASIC programs using standard 
numbers of line.  Beat RUN to execute the program.

IMPORTANT

- If commands produce an illegible visualization, for example white letters 
  on white background, press RUN/STOP and RESTORE keys simultaneously.  This 
  brings computer to the original state, where all sprites are off, each 
  sound comes interrupted and back to standard text mode. original state, 
  where all sprites are off, each sound comes interrupted and back to 
  standard text mode.  The program in memory remain unchanged.

- The created programs using SUPER EXPANDER 64 commands require that the 
  cartridge is inserted each time that a program comes performed.  In 
  contrary case, the SUPER EXPANDER 64 commands produce errors.

- In normal BASIC programs, the key-words has reduced to "token" to a 
  character (or internal symbols) for save memory.  Key-words of the 
  SUPER EXPANDER 64 are reduced to token of two characters.  Therefore, when 
  SUPER EXPANDER 64 commands are used in IF/THEN expressions, you must put 
  two points (:) between THEN and the key-word of the SUPER EXPANDER 64.

- If in a SUPER EXPANDER 64 command comes omitted an optional parameter, the 
  parameter will take on the value planned in a previous program.  This also 
  happen if the parameter was planned in a previous program.  Therefore, we 
  recommend you to don't omit optional parameters when any SUPER EXPANDER 64 
  command is used for the first time in a program. Additionally, when you 
  omit a parameter in a SUPER EXPANDER 64 command, you must use a comma like 
  "delimitator" if after it other indicators come formulated.



- 2 -  TEXT AND GRAPHICS

 	   Modes selection.
 	   Colors selection.
 	   Tracing of points and lines.
 	   Sketch of panels, circles and polygons.
 	   Contemporaneous use of texts and graphic.
 	   Memorization and reconditioning of forms.


TEXT AND GRAPHIC

This chapter describes how to select graphic modes of the SUPER EXPANDER 64 
and how to choose colors for design.  They come discussed also the ways to 
trace points and lines, design panels, circles and regular polygons. It will 
come indicated how to use visualizations of graphics and text togheter and 
also how to characterize and move forms on the screen.


2.1 - MODES SELECTION

The SUPER EXPANDER 64 program supports 4 graphic modes: text, multi-color, 
high resolution and split screen.  The desired mode can be select using the 
GRAPHIC command like show below:

GRAPHIC <mode>[,clear]

The required <mode> parameter is a number from 0 to 3 and it comes used for 
select one of the four graphic modes. 
When the optional parameter [,clear] is different from zero, the screen will 
come brought again to the background color (see bureau Colors Selection) 
after that the new mode has been select.  The following list show the four 
graphic modes and correspondent values <mode> of them:

0 = Standard text Mode
1 = Multi-Color Mode (Bit Map) 
2 = High Resolution Mode (Bit Map)
3 = Split Screen mode (contemporaneous Text and High Resolution) 

Here below examples of the GRAPHIC command are show:

GRAPHIC 1		select the Multi-Color Mode

GRAPHIC 2,1		select the High Resolution Mode and clear Bit Map screen

100 M= 3: C=: GRAPHIC M, C
110 REM line 100 selects the Split Screen Mode 
    and clear the screen

Another way to clear the screen without the use of GRAPHIC command is to use 
the SCNCLR command.  This command has the same effect of an [,clear] parameter
different from zero with the   GRAPHIC command.  The SCNCLR command comes used
alone without parameters:

100 SCNCLR	 Clear the screen in any mode.

The RGR (0) function shows the last graphic mode selected displaying a number 
from 0 to 3.  RGR (0) comes used exactly like indicated in examples: the 
number that comes returned coincides to the <mode> value used in the GRAPHIC 
command.  Here some examples:

20 GRAPHIC 3: PRINT RGR (0): END
30 REM LINE 20 PRINT A"3" WHEN IT COMES EXECUTED

100 IF RGR (0)> THEN: GRAPHIC 0,1
110 PRINT "RETURN TO TEXT MODE"

Here below is showed a brief description about every GRAPHIC mode and 
characteristics (see THE COMMODORE 64 PROGRAMMER'S MANUAL for a more detailed 
explanation).

STANDARD TEXT MODE

When you power on the computer, it is in the Standard Text mode.  In text 
mode, maximum 1000 characters could be displayed (25 rows of 40 characters 
each).  Each character comes represented through a matrix of 8x8 points in an 
any of the 16 available colors.

HIGH RESOLUTION MODE

The High Resolution mode comes used to create graphics at the maximum degree 
of precision and detail.  In this mode the screen is used like a grid 
with 320 horizontal points for 200 vertical points, so sketches appear very 
precise and resolved.  Each zone of 8x8 points of the screen  (these zones 
coincide to the characters position of the text) can be colored with two 
colors to choice (main color and background).

MULTI-COLOR MODE

With the Multi-Color mode the horizontal resolution comes sacrificed to the 
capability of use more colors.  The screen is composed from 160 horizontal 
points for 200 vertical points.  Each horizontal point is two times large 
than in the High Resolution mode.  The MultiColor mode allows use up to 4 
different colors in each zone of 8x8 points.  The 4 colors that you can set 
are Background, Main Color, Multi-Color 1 and Multi-Color 2.

SPLIT SCREEN MODE

The Split Screen mode gathers the High Resolution and Standard Text mode.  
In the Split Screen  mode the upper part of the screen is a Bit Map at High 
Resolution with 320 horizontal points and 160 vertical points.  The lower 
part of the screen is a "window" where it is possible display five (5) lines 
of Standard Text.  For more examples about the GRAPHIC mode, see photos on 
the rear of this handbook and the III Appendix PROGRAM EXAMPLES.


2.2 - COLORS SELECTION

On the Commodore 64 is possible independently to set the Background area, the 
Frame and the Main Color on any of the 16 colors. You can set also two 
multi-color "registers", but it will have effect only in GRAPHIC Multi-Color 
mode.  With the SUPER EXPANDER 64 one can use the COLOR command to select 
colors chosen for these areas or "color sources".  The syntax for the COLOR 
command is the following:

COLOR [background][,[main color][,[mcr1][,[mcr2][,frame]]]]

The [background] parameter determine the color of the Background.  The [main 
color] parameter determine the color of the Main Color, that is the color of 
characters in text mode and of best part of  forms design in High Resolution 
mode.  [mcr1] and [mcr2] parameters are the Multi-Color registers.  
The [,frame] parameter determines the color of the External Frame.  Any color 
of the 16 available on the Commodore 64 can be used for each of  5 parameters 
of the COLOR command.  From now we'll become reference to each of these 
indicators like "color sources".  For select a color source for an area, you 
must simply indicate the number of "code color" in the appropiate position of 
the COLOR command.  Follows a list of colors and their correspondent color 
code:

	COLOR		CODE	COLOR		CODE
	Black		0	Orange	8
	White		1	Brown		9
	Red		2	Light red	10
	Light blue 	3	Dark grey	11
	Purple	4	Middle grey	12
	Green		5	Light green	13
	Blue		6	Blue clear	14
	Yellow	7	Light grey	15

Remembering of use a comma to delimit the omitting fields (these remain with 
color formerly set).  For example, to obtain a black background, white 
characters and a external grey frame, a COLOR command must be used like it 
follows:

COLOR 0,1,15     	It sets the color of the Background on black, the 
			Main Color on white and the Frame on grey clear.  
			This doesn't change the color of the Multi-Color 1 or 
			the Multi-Color 2.

COLOR, 3     	It sets only the Frame on Light Blue. Other areas maintain 
			the preceding set.

Note that to change the Background color have a immediate effect only in 
TEXT mode.  In any GRAPHIC mode the Background color formerly selected 
appears when it starts to draw or after the SCNCLR command.
For more examples about the COLOR command, see photos To check which colors 
have been set for last, the RCLR function is used. The syntax for this 
function is the following:

RCLR (<area>)

The <area> parameter is a number from 0 to 4 that coincides at one of the 
five areas of the screen which color of it is set by the COLR command.  
For example, if <area> is 0, then RCLR will display the  color code (a number 
from 0 to 15) that has been indicated for last for the background of the 
screen.  It comes show here below how to examine each of color registers of 
the screen:

RCLR (0)	display the Background color code
RCLR (1)	display the Main Color code
RCLR (2)	display the Multi-Color 1 color code
RCLR (3)	display the Multi-Color 2 color code
RCLR (4)	display the External Frame color code

A program example to test RCLR follows:

10 COLOR 0,7,2,3,4
20 FOR C= 0 TO 4
30 PRINT RCLR (C) 
40 NEXT C


2.3 - TRACING OF POINTS AND LINES
 
Before start to design, it is main point to understand a fundamental concept:
the Cursor Pixel (CP).  The  CP is similar to the mobile cursor that can be 
seen in the Text mode, that show where the next  character will appear.
Also if it is invisible, the CP point out where the next point on the High 
Resolution or Multi-Color screen will come allocated.  In the SUPER EXPANDER 
64 commands where the optional coordinates are omitted, the CP is also used 
like default coordinate.  Specific examples of the custom of the  CP like 
default coordinate will be treated in the following explanations of the 
command.

The command LOCATE allows to dispose the CP in any point on the screen. 
Results of the command LOCATE will not appear until when something will be 
designed.
The syntax for the command LOCATE is:

LOCATE <X,Y>

the "X" part of the <X,Y> parameter required represent the horizontal distance
across the screen express in number of points.  When "X" is even to 0, the CP 
is on the left border of the screen. The "Y" part of the <X,Y> parameter 
represent the vertical distance along the screen express in number of points.
When "Y" is even to 0, the CP is on the upper border of the screen. In the  
SUPER EXPANDER 64 commands, if an optional X-Y coordinate is omitted, the 
current CP is used like  default position.  For every SUPER EXPANDER 64 
command that will be explain, will be specify of time in time which X-Y 
coordinates are optional.  The X and Y coordinates can be itemize like value 
and like discard from the present position of the CP.  Putting the plus sign 
or a minus sign (+,-) before the X or Y value, the CP comes moved in a 
positive or negative direction relatively to his actual position.  The plus 
sign before the X value moves the CP to right and the sign minus moves the CP 
to left. To the same way, the plus sign in front of the Y value moves the CP 
to the lower part from his actual position, and the  sign minus moves the CP 
to the top.  Wherever a X or Y coordinate of SUPER EXPANDER 64  absolute 
values or discards.
Some examples about LOCATE command follow:

10 LOCATE 0,0 	  Sets the CP to the upper left angle of the screen.
50 LOCATE 160,100	  Sets the CP in the exact center of the High Resolution 
			  screen.
80 LOCATE -40, +20  Moves the CP of 40 points to left and of 20 to the lower 
			  part.

In these examples the new positions of the CP have been set like an absolute 
X and Y coordinate and also like a relative discard.  In this and other 
commands of the SUPER EXPANDER 64 could be used an alternative way for 
express the new position.  In the command LOCATE like in different other 
commands for design, you can use a semicolon to the place of the comma to 
express a distance and a relative angle to the present position of the CP.  
For example:

LOCATE 50;45

The CP comes moved from actual position of him for a distance of 50 points to 
an angle of 45 degrees.  The position of the CP could be altered from other 
SUPER EXPANDER 64 commands, for example  DRAW, BOX, CIRCLE. You can discover 
in any moment where CP is locate using the RDOT function, which will furnish 
the X and Y coordinate, or the source of color for the CP on its actual 
position.
The syntax for the RDOT command is the following:

RDOT (<data>)

When the <data> parameter is 0, the X coordinate of the CP position comes 
displayed, when 1 is the Y coordinate; and when the <data> parameter has the 
value 2, a number from 0 to 3 comes displayed. This number represents the 
source of color (like showed for the COLOR command) for the point to the 
current position of the CP and it comes indicated in the following chart:

0= Background
1= Main Color
2= Multi-Color 1
3= Multi-Color 2

The value of sources of color displays from RDOT (2) coincides to the 
positions of parameter fields  in the COLOR command.
Here some examples with the custom of the RDOT function:

10 X= RDOT (0)			The horizontal position of the CP comes put in 
					the variable "X."
20 B= 1: PRINT RDOT (B)		Print the vertical position of the CP.
30 LOCATE X,Y:CT=RDOT(2)	Identifies the source of color for the point 
					in the X,Y position.

Now is possible use the DRAW command for design on the screen simple straight 
lines. The syntax for the DRAW command is the following:

DRAW [source][,X1,Y1][ TO X2,Y1,Y2]...

In the DRAW command,[ source] is the source of color for the line that must 
be designed and it can  have values from 0 to 3, correspondent to the 
preceding RDOT chart.  If [source] is omitted, for design comes used the 
source of color for the Main Color.  The line begins to the position 
[,X1,Y1].  If this parameter is omitted, the line begins to the current 
position of the CP.  The line has described up to [X2,Y2] if they are present,
otherwise on [X1,Y1] is designed an only point.  To design a line moves the 
position of the CP on the last point drawed.  Can be used absolute values of 
coordinate or relative discards, also for both the X-Y positions.   
Additionally, an alternative form of the DRAW command that allows to describe 
a line to depart from the actual CP with a definite angle until to a date 
distance (using a point and comma to the place of the comma).  For example:

DRAW [source][,<dist>;<angle>][ TO <dist>;<angle>]...

The line will come described for the given distance (express in number of 
points), to the itemized angle (express in degrees, where 0 degrees point out 
an upright to the top) from the actual position of the CP.  Must be itemized 
both parameters of the distance and of the angle.  Here follows some 
examples of the DRAW command (be sure to itemize GRAPHIC 2,1 before try 
these examples):

DRAW 1,100,50	 		design a point in the color of the Main Color1.
DRAW TO 200, 100			The CP is used for begin the line to 100,150.
DRAW, 10,10 TO 100,60
DRAW 3 TO -20, +40		use a relative discard for X2, Y2.
DRAW 2 TO 25;30			The line is long 25 points, to 30 degrees from 
					the actual CP.
DRAW,10,10 TO 10,60 TO 100,60 TO 10,10
DRAW 0,100,50			delete the point designed with the first 
					example.

For more examples about the DRAW command, see photos  on the rear of this 
handbook and the III Appendix PROGRAM EXAMPLES.
 

2.4 - SKETCH OF PANELS, CIRCLES AND POLYGONS

The BOX command allows to design a rectangle in any point of the screen. The 
rectangle could be of any measure and have any proportion.  Characteristics 
peculiars of the command BOX allows to rotate the rectangle of any angle or 
color all panel automatically. 
The syntax for the BOX command is the following:

BOX [source]<,X1,Y1>[,[X2,Y2][,[angle][,filling]]]

It in this example of syntax could be omitted any of the parameters [X2,Y2] 
or [angle] or [filling].  However, is necessary assure to use commas like 
delimitators in the case are itemized some indicators after those omitted.
[source] is the source of color for the rectangle.  If [source] is omitted, 
it comes used the source of color of the Main Color.  The PANEL comes designed
starting from [X2,Y2] if specified (otherwise, from the current position of 
the CP), to the required position<,X1,Y1>.  The final position of the CP will 
be to [X2,Y2] if the [angle] parameter is omitted or is even to zero. 
Parameters [angle] and [,filling] are both optional.  The parameter [angle] 
determine the degrees of gyration in hourly sense around the center of the 
rectangle.  If the parameter [,filling]  is different  from zero, the panel 
will come filled with the same color of the edge of the rectangle (source of 
color).
Here some examples of the BOX command (It is necessary itemize GRAPHIC 2,1 
before try these  examples):

BOX 1,10,10,60,60			design a quadrate.
BOX 1, +80, +40			this panel uses a discard relative to the 
					actual value of the CP.
BOX, 10,10,60,60,45,1		rotate the quadrate and color it internally.
BOX 1,0,0,319,199			design a panel around the High Resolution  
					screen as soon as to the inland of the frame.
BOX 1,30; 45, 1			The distance and the angle from the CP determine
					the position of the opposite angle.

As you can see in the last example, BOX is another command that can be 
altered for itemize a distance and an angle, with the simply use of a 
semicolon to the place of a comma.  The actual position of the CP comes used 
like the point of departure to design a rectangle.  So, the diagonal opposite 
angle comes identified moving the CP for a distance of 30 to an angle of 45 
degrees.  This point is after used like coordinates< X1,Y1>.

With the CIRCLE command of the SUPER EXPANDER 64 can be designed arcs, 
circles, ellipsis and  also triangles and other polygons.  
The syntax for the CIRCLE command is the following:

CIRCLE [source],[X1,Y1]<,X-radius>[,[Y-radius][,[start][,[end]
[,[angle][,[inc]]]]]

[source] is the source of color for the circle. The origin (or center) is 
locate to [X1,Y1] (if omitted, the current CP comes used).  Like for the 
preceding commands, in the CIRCLE command can be used absolute values, 
relative discards or distance and angle for parameter [X1,Y1].  The parameter 
<,X-radius> is necessary and determine the horizontal radius of the circle 
expressed in number of points.  The optional indicator [Y-radius] determine 
the upright radius of the circle expressed in number of points (if omitted, 
the value <X-radius> comes used).
The optional parameter [start] and [end] characterize the points of departure 
and arrival of an arc in the circumference of the circle.  The default values 
for [start] and [end] are respectively 0 and 360.  These points come data in 
degrees (where 0 is upright toward the top, 90 is right hand, 180 is toward 
the lower part, etc.). The parameter [angle] is 0 (example: no gyration).
The final position of the CP will be on the circumference of the circle to 
the angle of the arc [end].  Cause of the difference among the number of 
horizontal and upright points on the protection, setting the X radius even to 
the Y radius will come designed an ellipse and not a circle.  To design a 
circle, the scale of the values of the radius should draw near to the report 
among the number of the horizontal and upright points on the screen. This 
report will depend on the graphic mode that is being used.  Subsequent 
information  respect to the report among the X-Y coordinates will come to 
present in the explanation of the SCALE command.
The SUPER EXPANDER 64 designs circles with a series of lines.  This is made 
calculating the following point on the circumference of the circle and after 
design a line from the preceding point.  The parameter [,inc], incremental 
value, specific how much degrees the CP comes moved around to the circle 
(in hourly sense) describing the following line.  The default value for the 
increase is 2 degrees.  Increasing the incremental value, the contour of the 
circle always becomes coarser, up to the point in which the circle appears 
like a regular polygon.
Follows a series of examples that illustrate the CIRCLE command (It is 
necessary itemize GRAPHIC 2,1 before try these examples):

CIRCLE 1,160,100,100,75		Circle
CIRCLE 1,160,100,65,10		Ellipse
CIRCLE 1,160,100,65,10, 45	Rotated ellipse
CIRCLE, 60,40,20,18, 45		Octagon
CIRCLE, 260,40,20, 90		Diamond
CIRCLE, 60,140,20,18, 120	Triangle

The PAINT command allows to color a limited area.  The syntax for PAINT is 
the following:

PAINT [source][,[X1,Y1][,stop]]

[source] determine the source of the color to use (Background, Main Color, 
Multi-Color1, Multi-Color2).  The fill will begin to the actual position of 
the CP or to [X1,Y1] if itemized.  For the coordinate [X1,Y1] you can use 
absolute values, relative discards or distance and angle.  The fill around 
the position [X1,Y1] continue until it doesn't meet a delimitation.  The 
parameter [,stop] specific what kind of delimitation will stop the color.  If 
[,stop] is 0, PAINT will expand the color until to meet a delimitation that 
has his same source of color.  If [,stop] is 1, PAINT will expand the color 
until to any contour of Main Color or Multi-color.  The final position of the 
CP will be to [X1,Y1] when the fill has completed.  If the coordinate [X1,Y1] 
are locate on a point of the same source of color used with the PAINT command,
any fill won't have effected.  Example:

CIRCLE 1,160,100,65,50: PAINT 1

In the following examples the lines from 10 to 30 have performed before the 
PAINT command:

10 COLOR 1, 11: GRAPHIC 1, 1
20 CIRCLE 1,80,100,50,40
30 CIRCLE 2,100,100,50,40
50 PAINT 1, 110,100,1
60 PAINT 2,110,100,0
70 PAINT 0,110, 100

The line 50 will fill the coincident portions of the two circles with the 
actual color of Main Color.  The  line 60 will fill all the Multi-Color 
circle described from the line 30.  Using a source of color with value 0 
(color of Background) comes blanked an area and his contour like indicated 
from the line 70.  Until now, in the program examples, the X and Y 
coordinates have been use identical to those recognized from the computer 
video chip control.  Beyond to this system of coordinates "standard," the  
SUPER EXPANDER 64 furnishes an alternative series for the X and Y coordinates.

Is possible to pass from a series to the other, using the command SCALE. 
The syntax for the command SCALE is the following:

SCALE <n>

When <n> is 0, the SUPER EXPANDER 64 uses the system of standard coordinates.
In the SCALE 0, the  X-Y coordinate for the limits of the screen depend on 
the distinctive GRAPHIC mode that is in use.
When <n> is 1, comes used the system of special coordinates of the SUPER 
EXPANDER 64.  In SCALE 1, both X and Y coordinates change from 0 to 1023, 
independently from any GRAPHIC mode selected.  The following chart show the 
coordinates of the limit of the screen for each of the Bit Map GRAPHIC mode 
in both the series:

Series  Mode				Coord.- X		Coord.- Y
0	  Multi-Color (GRAPHIC 1)	from 0 to 159	from Or to 199
0	  High Resolution (GRAPHIC 2)	from 0 to 319	from 0 to 199
0	  Split Screen (GRAPHIC 3)	from 0 to 319	from 0 to 159
1	  All the GRAPHIC mode		from 0 to 1023	from 0 to 1023

You can see from the preceding chart that many activity of the programmation 
can be more easy using SCALE 1, because it gives you the same X and Y 
coordinate for all GRAPHIC mode.  Here a example of how to use both the 
scales in a program:

10 COLOR 1,9,12: GRAPHIC 2,1
20 SCALE 0:CIRCLE 1,160,100,50,40
30 SCALE 1:COLOR,6:CIRCLE 1,512,512,140,280
40 GOTO 40

This program designs a brown circle on the screen using SCALE 0, so it 
designs a  blue circle just inside the first, using SCALE 1. The origin of 
both circles are the exact center of the screen.
From the chart of the coordinates of the screen limit it could be seen that 
the range of values of the  X-Y coordinate engage reports decided 
reciprocally.  These reports change to according of the distinctive GRAPHIC 
mode that is being used.  The following chart show the reports of the values 
of the X-Y coordinates for each of the GRAPHIC mode.  You can use some 
ratioes in your programs to design "real" circles, quadrates,  etc. Using 
these reports it is possible calculate the exact proportions of the forms 
that want to be designed, also one could not appear "perfect", cause 
differences among varied monitors.

Mode					To calculate X 	To calculate Y
Multi-Color (GRAPHIC 1)		.8* Y			1.25* X
High Resolution (GRAPHIC 2)	1.6* Y		.625* X
Split Screen (GRAPHIC 3)	1.6* Y		.625* X

on the rear of this handbook and the III Appendix PROGRAM EXAMPLES.


2.5 - CONTEMPORANEOUS USE OF TEXTS AND GRAPHICS

In this bureau, will come treated the CHAR command, that allows to use 
contemporaneously a visualization of text (only capital letter and graphic 
characters) and a visualization Bit Map to High Resolution and Multi-Color.  
Against to the PRINT command that can be used only in the Text Standard mode 
or in the five lines in low of the Split Screen mode, the CHAR command can 
arrange the text in any point on the screen, in any mode.
The syntax for the CHAR command is the following:

CHAR [source],<column,row>,<string>[,inversion]

[source] is the source of color for the text.  In the High Resolution mode 
and Split Screen only the values [source] 0 or 1 have meant.  Using for 
[source] the value 0 (Background), is been able to "blank" the text displayed 
on the screen.  Using for [source] the value 1, the text will be displayed in 
the actual color of Main Color.
Parameter <column,row> is necessary. < column> can change from 0 to 39, where 
the column 0 is locates to the extreme left side of the screen.  <row> can 
change from 0 to 24, where row 0 is the first row of the screen.  These 
changes of parameters coincide the measure of the screen 40x25 of the Text 
Standard mode.
For the parameter <string>, an alphabetical string among quote ("string") can 
be used or the name of a string variable of the program.  Exactly like for 
the PRINT statement, if the text string of CHAR overcome the current row of 
characters on the screen, it will continue automatically on the  following 
row, starting from the first column.
The parameter [,inversion] can have value 0 or 1 and arouses the visualization
of inverted characters.   The effects of the parameter inversion depends on 
the mode that is being used.  In the Text Standard mode the parameter 
[,inversion]  comes ignored, and the CHAR string comes displayed exactly when 
PRINT is used.  This also affects the use not the control characters Press 
for color selection, cursor movement, and the inverted field.  In the High 
Resolution mode or Split Screen, if the parameter [,inversion] has the value 
0, the text will come displayed commonly.  If [,inversion] has the value 1, 
the complete CHAR string comes displayed in inverted video.  In these ways 
(and in Multi-Color mode), the control characters in the  string are'nt 
advised like "controls" and they come printed.  In the Multi-Color mode the 
effects of the parameter [,inversion] depend on the value of the parameter 
[source].  If [source] is 1, 2 or 3 and the parameter inversion is 0, the text
comes displayed commonly and if [,inversion] is 1, the text has displayed in 
inverted video.  In both cases, the source of select color comes used.  In the
Multi-Color mode, if [source] is zero, the text comes displayed always in the 
Main Color, not in the color of Background, that would have been used in other
way.  Additionally, if also [,inversion] is zero, the characters of the text 
will come displayed with a Background of Multi-Color1; and if [,inversion] is 
1, the characters will come displayed with a Background of Multi-Color2.
Follows a scheme of how the values of [source] and [,inversion] have effect 
on like CHAR will display the text in the Multi-Color mode.

Source	Inversion	Description of the Obtained Text

1,2,3		0	Normal video in the source of color	select
1,2,3		1	Inverted video in the source of color select
0		1	The text is in Main Color, the Background is Multi-Color1
0		1	The text is in Main Color, the Background is Multi-Color2

To illustrate the preceding descriptions of CHAR, follows an example of 
program that show the effects  of parameters value [source] and [,inversion] 
in both the modes High Resolution and Multi-Color:

10 COLOR 1,0,6,9,15: GRAPHIC 2,1
20 CHAR 0,1,1 "SOURCE= 0 INVERSION= 0," 0
30 CHAR 0,1,3 "SOURCE= 0 INVERSION= 1," 1
40 CHAR 0,1,5 "SOURCE= 1 INVERSION= 0," 0
50 CHAR 0,1,7 "SOURCE= 1 INVERSION= l," 1
60 CHAR 0,1,9 "SOURCE= 2 INVERSION= 0," 0
70 CHAR 0,1,11 "SOURCE= 2 INVERSION= 1," 1
80 CHAR 0,1,13 "SOURCE= 3 INVERISONE= 0," 0
90 CHAR 0,1,15 "SOURCE= 3 INVERISONE= l," 1
100 GET A$: IF A$="" THEN 100
110 IF RGR (0)= 2 THEN: GRAPHIC 1,1: GOTO 20
120 STOP

The program will display different rows of text in High Resolution mode at 
first, then will wait for a pressed key.  Then the program will pass to the 
Multi-Color mode and will re-displayed the same text.  In this program come 
use all the possible combinations of parameters [source] and [,inversion].
CHAR can be used with a source of color 0 (Background) for blank the normal 
and inverted video of text with a source of color 1 (Main Color); or, to 
insert some text in an area that was colored or filled with a BOX command (in 
Main Color).  For more examples about CHAR command, see photos  on the rear 
of this handbook and the III Appendix PROGRAM EXAMPLES.
  

2.6 - MEMORIZATION AND RECONDITIONING OF FORMS

A notable characteristic of the SUPER EXPANDER 64 is the ability of transform 
graphic forms from the video in variable BASIC string or vice versa (from 
string to screen).  The SSHAPE comes used to transform a rectangular area of 
a Bit Map screen (Multi-Color mode, High Resolution, or Split Screen) in a 
variable BASIC bootlace.
The syntax for the SSHAPE command is the following:

SSHAPE <string name>,<X1,Y1>[,X2,Y2]

<string name> is the name of the variable BASIC string that will receive the 
relative data to the form.  As it happens for the BOX command, the optional 
parameter [,X2, Y2] sets the point of departure to  memorize a form.  If 
[,X2,Y2] comes omitted, comes used the current position of the CP.  The 
required parameter <X1,Y1> identifies the angle across opposite of the 
rectangular area that one  wants to memorize.  The SSHAPE command doesn't 
bias the position of the CP.  The BASIC thresholds the length of the string 
to a maximum of 255 characters, so the dimension of the area that can be 
memorized with SSHAPE is finite.  The dimension of the necessary string can 
be calculated to memorize a form using one of the following formulas (these 
formulas presuppose that have been used a SCALE 0).

For the Multi-Color mode, the measure of the string is equal to:

INT (ABS (X1-X2) +1)/ 4+ .99)* (ABS (Yl-Y2) +1) +4

For the High Resolution or Split Screen, the dimension of the string is 
equal to:

INT (ABS (X1-X2) +1)/ 8+ .99)* (ABS (Y1-Y2) +1) +4

In the case SSHAPE on SCALE 1 is being used, must be  divided the difference 
of "X1-X2" for 3.2 and must be divided the difference of "Y1-Y2" for 5.12. 
After, these results must take the place of the respective operations of 
subtraction in both preceding formulas.  To example, if SSHAPE in SCALE 1 is 
being used, you can determine the dimension of the string for the High 
Resolution mode or Split Screen with the following passages:

A=INT (ABS (X1-X2)/ 3.2+1)
B=INT (ABS (Y1-Y2)/ 5.12+1)
DIMENSION=INT (A/ 8+ .99)* B+4

The form comes transformed in a string, row to row.  The last four positions 
of the string will contain the length of the column and of the row.  These 
last comes to use from the command GSHAPE to bring the strings on the screen.
Follow some examples to illustrate the command SSHAPE:

SSHAPE A$,0,0,50,50
Memorize an area located in the left upper angle of the screen

SCALE 0: SSHAPE B$, 40, 20,200,120
Memorize an area located near to the center of the screen

SCALE 1: SSHAPE D$ (6), 512,512,640,580
Memorize an area located near to the center of the screen

SSHAPE K$,480,480
Memorize from the CP to 480,480

The GSHAPE command is the opposite of SSHAPE.  It display the content of a 
string variable on a  video Bit Map.  The syntax for the GSHAPE command is:

GSHAPE <string name>[,[X1,Y1][,method]]

<string name> is the name of a variable BASIC string that comes used like the 
source for design the form on the screen.  The optional parameter [X1,Y1] 
characterizes  the left upper angle of the form like it comes designed on the 
screen.  If [X1,Y1] is omitted, comes used the actual position of the CP.  
The optional parameter [,method] specific like the form will come designed on 
the  screen. The GSHAPE command doesn't change the position of the CP.
The parameter [,method] allows to dispose the form choosing among five 
different methods, combining the data of abstracted form from the string with 
images you already insert on the screen.  This parameter can have a value 
from 0 to 4. The following chart show the values and the correspondent 
methods of positioning of them; every method will come treatise more clear 
ahead:

0 Design the form LIKE IT HAS MEMORIZED
1 Design the form In NEGATIVE
2 "OR" among the form and the screen
3 "AND" among the form and the screen
4 "XOR" among the form and the screen

0	Design the form like it has been memorized, covering the actual image.  
	The form-string replaces all that had been formerly displayed.

1	Design the form like it has been memorized, reversing the areas of color
	of the Main Color of the string with the color Background and vice 
	versa.

2	Play a logical OR of the data of contained form in the string with the 
	data of image on the screen.  This "adds" the form of the string to the 
	screen.  The result is that both the forms come fused together and each 
	part of both comes displayed.

3	Play a logical AND of the data of contained form in the string with the 
	data of image on the  screen.  This "blank" the parts of the two forms 
	that don't coincide.  The result is that are displayed only the points 
	where the two forms coincide.

4	Play a logical XOR (exclusive OR) of the data of contained form in the 
	string with the data of  image on the screen.  The result is that only 
	those portions of two forms that were different will be displayed.

These descriptions of the parameter [,method] are applicabled to images of the
High Resolution.  In the  Multi-Color mode the effects of inversion and they 
of logical operations on the forms can instead be a change of color.  This 
depends on the sources of color you use for the two forms, because the 
Multi-color points on the screen is wide 2 bit.
The following is an example of GSHAPE and SSHAPE:

10 SCNCLR
20 GRAPHIC 2,1: WOODWORK 1: COLOR 6,14, 6
30 CIRCLE, 530,530,18,18
40 PAINT 1,530,530,0
50 SSHAPE D$,512,512,640,580: REM MEMORIZES CIRCLE
   COLORED
60 FOR T= 0 TO 1000: NEXT T
70 SCNCLR: FOR T= 0 TO 1000: NEXT T
80 GSHAPE D$,512,512: REM RESTORES COLORED CIRCLE

Beyond to memorize and restore forms of the screen and vice versa, you could 
be used GSHAPE and SSHAPE  with SPRSAV (a command that check a form of sprite)
to change graphic forms in sprite or vice versa.  This concept will come more 
clarified in the chapter about the graphic sprite.  To have a color example 
of the effect of the SSHAPE commands and GSHAPE, consult the photos  on the 
rear of this handbook.  To see the printout of the program that has been 
created this figure see the III Appendix PROGRAM EXAMPLES Printout 5.



- 3 -  GRAPHIC SPRITE

One of more interesting characteristics of the Commodore 64 is his ability of 
display objects said "sprite".  Sprites are graphic images that can be 
characterized and dispose in any point inside and outside the screen.  
Sprites are particularly proper for animations to graphic purpose or of 
entertainment.  In each moment can be displayed on the screen up to 8 sprite. 
It is possible characterize each sprite like a figure in High Resolution or 
Multi-Color  and each one can be expanded in the X and/or Y direction.
Additionally, sprites can be combined among of them to create bigger graphic 
images and colored.  To each sprite can be assigned a "precedence of 
visualization" that will do appear his movement like if it happens before or 
behind to the images of the visualization graphic Bit Map.  This 
characteristic allows to create a graphic three-dimensional effect.  
The SUPER EXPANDER 64  is also able to note when an any sprite encounters or 
enters in bump with an other sprite or with a form in the visualization Bit 
Map.


3.1 - SPRITE DESIGNER MODE

The SUPER EXPANDER 64 is gifted of a Sprite Designer Mode that makes very easy
to chart and build sprites.  The Sprite Designer can be played from the Direct
mode and also from a BASIC program. While the Sprite Designer is being used, 
the execution of the BASIC program is suspended and the SUPER EXPANDER 64 
furnishes different functional controls of keyboard for the Sprite Designer.  
To go on the Sprite Designer mode, the SPRDEF command is used.  This command 
doesn't have parameters.  When you enter in Sprite Designer mode, the screen 
comes blanked and appears a wide area to design a sprite in the left part of 
the screen.  As soon as ander to this area appears the message "SPRITE 
NUMBER?". Insert a number from 0 to 7 that coincides to the sprite that wants 
to be characterized  or alter.  You note that, after the sprite number, 
RETURN must not be pressed.  To this point, the actual definition of the 
selected sprite comes displayed in the area reserved to the sketch, and also 
in his real dimension on the right side of the screen.  In the upper left 
angle of the area reserved the sketch a cursor will be seen that is formed 
from a sign + individual or double (+,++) respectively for the sprite in High 
Resolution or Multi-color.  Keys of control could be used to move the cursor 
inside the area reserved to the sketch. The HOME key disposes the cursor in 
the upper left angle of the area reserved for the sketch.  The key CLR brings 
again the area reserved to the sketch to the color of Background and disposes 
the cursor in the upper left angle.  There are four keys that come used like 
special "functional controls" to make more easy the planning of a sprite.  
They are the keys:  "A, M, X and Y," each of them commute ON or OFF a 
specific function each time that the key comes pressed.  Keys function are:

Key	Function
A	Automatic movement of the cursor
M	Commute the visualization mode of the sprite
X	Commute the X expansion of the sprite
Y	Commute the Y expansion of the sprite

While is activated the function Automatism of the Cursor, coloring a point of 
the sprite sketch, the  cursor comes automatically moved on the following 
position.  When this function is deactivated, the keys of control of the 
cursor must be used.  When the "M" key is pressed, the sprite in real 
dimension on the right of the screen, withered from the High Resolution mode 
to the Multi-Color or vice versa.  Additionally, the image that appears in 
the area  reserved to the sketch will change of consequence.  The key "X" 
expands or reduces the horizontal dimension of the sprite each time that the 
key comes pressed.  To the same way, the key "Y" expands or reduces the 
vertical dimension of the sprite each time the key comes pressed.  The Main 
Color of the sprite could be set using the color-control keys of the Commodore
64 in the usual way.  Pressing the CTRL key together to a digital key (1-8), 
you select the codes of color from 0 to 7.  Pressing the Commodore key 
together to a digital key (1-8), the codes of color are selected from 8 to 15.
This set of the Main Color for the sprite results comfortable to display the  
sprite while his form is being characterized.  The SPRITE command (explained 
ahead in this chapter) is used to set "permanently" the Main Color of the 
sprite in the programs.  The Main Color for the sprite comes decided 
separately and independently from the Bit Map for the color of Main Color of 
the text.  The same is for Multi-Color1 selection and Multi-Color2, they 
could be set only out from the Sprite Designer using the SPRCOL command 
(explained ahead in this chapter).  Therefore, to design a Multi-Color sprite,
must be used the command SPRCOL before enter to the Sprite Designer.  When you
are ready to color the area reserved to the sketch, digital keys from 1 to 4 
come used to select a source of color for each point in the area reserved to 
the sketch.  The following stripes show these numbers and the sources of color
associated to them:

Key	Source of color
1	Background Color of the Screen
2	Main Color of the Sprite
3	Multi-Color1 of the Sprite
4	Multi-Color2 of the Sprite

Finally, when the sketch of the sprite has been finished and wants to keep it 
for a successive use, hold pressed the SHIFT key while the RETURN key is 
pressed.  Pressing the STOP key cancel out all the changes that has been 
effected in the area reserved to the sketch on the screen, but the actual  
definition of the sprite stays unchanged.  If the sprite has been memorized 
or not, the Sprite Designer returns to the prompt "SPRITE NUMBER ?". To this 
point, you can insert a number of sprite for continue to characterize sprite, 
or leave the Sprite Designer pressing the RETURN key.  If the command SPRDEF 
has been used  in a BASIC program and the Sprite Designer is left, the SUPER 
EXPANDER 64  will take back the execution of the program.


3.2 - DEFINITIONS OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SPRITE

After have characterized some sprite images, and before use them in programs, 
must be set their characteristics of visualization: colors, dimensions, 
precedence of visualization and mode.  
Command SPRCOL and SPRITE allow to choose each of these characteristics for 
the sprite.
The SPRCOL command imposes the Multi-Color1 colors and Multi-Color2 for all 
sprites.  If will be used the Sprite Designer to create sprite in the 
Multi-Color mode, first must be used the SPRCOL command; otherwise, the area 
reserved to the sketch and the "sprite sample" can not be displayed  
correctly.  These Multi-Color colors for the sprite must not be confused with 
the colors Bit Map Multi-Color1 and Multi-Color2 decided from the COLOR 
command.  The Multi-Color colors for the sprite come decided  separately from 
the SPRCOL command.  The syntax of the SPRCOL command is the following:

SPRCOL [smcr-1][,smcr-2]

The parameter [smcr-1] imposes the Multi-Color1 for all sprites, and [,smcr-2]
imposes the multi-Color2 for all sprites.  Each of these parameters can be a 
code color from 0 to 15, correspondent to the chart show for the COLOR 
command.  If one of the parameters of color comes omitted, his current value  
of color stays unaffected.  Only the sprite that have set on the Multi-Color 
mode with the command SPRITE, will display one of these colors.  Follow some 
examples how to set the color Multi-Color for sprites:

10 MA= 2: MB= 7: SPRCOL MA, MB: REM IMPOSED THE MULTI-COLOR1 OF SPRITE ON 
   RED AND THE MULTI-COLOR2 ON YELLOW

150 SPRCOL, 6: REM LEAVES MULTI-COLOR1 UNAFFECTED

Use the RSPCOL function to check the last value setting of the Multi-Color of 
the sprite.  This function returns the value of the actual color-code for 
"registers" Multi-Color of the sprite.  The syntax of the RSPCOL function is 
the following:

RSPCOL (<register>)

The topic <register> can have a value 0 or 1. When < register> it is 0, RSPCOL
returns the code of Multi-Color1 color of the sprite express like a number 
from 0 to 15.  To the same way, when <register> is 1, RSPCOL returns the 
color-code for the Multi-Color2 of the sprite.  Here of succession comes show 
some examples on the use of RSPCOL function:

200 PRINT RSPCOL (0), RSPCOL (1): REM PRINT VALUES OF BOTH
    MULTI-COLOR OF THE SPRITE
300 IF RSPCOL (0)= 6 THEN: SPRCOL 4: REM SET MULTI-COLOR1 OF SPRITE 
    ON PURPLE, IF IT WAS ON BLUE

For each sprite the SPRITE command can be used to set some characteristics.  
This include the ON/OFF commutations of the sprite, the setting of a mode, 
the color of the Main Color and the property of visualization.  With the 
SPRITE command you can change the horizontal dimension and/or vertical of 
each sprite.  Any omitted parameter will maintain unaffected the 
characteristics on their last setting. The syntax for the SPRITE command is 
the following:

SPRITE <number>[,[on/off][,[main color][,[precedence]
[,[x-exp][,[y-exp][,mode]]]]]]

The parameter <number> required specific which sprite the command refers and 
his value must change from 0 to 7. The field [on/off] resolve the sprite 
comes displayed or not.  When the value of this field is 1, the sprite comes 
displayed (ON); if this field is 0, the sprite comes set OFF.  The parameter 
[main color] sets the color of the sprite Main Color on a color-code from 0 
to 15.  The field [precedence] furnishes to the sprite a "precedence of 
visualization that "show" it like if it moves before or behind the 
visualization Bit Map when the sprite become animated.  If the value of  
[precedence] is 1, the sprite will appear "behind" the visualization Bit Map.
This imposes the sprite on the precedence "Low."  If the value of precedence 
is 0, the sprite will appear "before" to the visualization, setting the sprite
on the precedence "High".  In this way a three-dimensional effect for an 
animate graphics and colors is created.  The relation among the precedences of
the sprite comes set in way that the sprite with the lower number comes 
displayed in front of those with the higher number.  The sprite 0 has the 
higher precedence and the sprite 7 has that lower.  Parameters of expansion 
of the sprite, [x-exp] and [y-exp],  allow to expand in independent way a 
sprite to the double of his dimension in one or in both the X-Y directions, or
of reduce the sprite to the normal dimension.  If the field is 1, the sprite 
doubles his dimension in the horizontal direction (X); if the field [x-exp] is
0, the sprite presents itself to normal width. In way analogous, when the 
field [y-exp] is 1, the sprite doubles his dimension in vertical direction 
(Y); if the field [y-exp] is 0, the sprite presents itself to normal height.
When you Expands a sprite, the number of points that characterizes the image 
of the sprite doesn't change; instead, the dimension of any point comes 
doubled in the select direction.
The parameter [,mode] resolve if a sprite will come displayed in High 
Resolution or in Multi-Color. If the value of [,mode] is 0, the sprite comes 
displayed in High Resolution, 24 points of width for 21 points of height. If 
the value of [,mode] is 1, the sprite comes displayed in Multi-Color, 12 
points of width for 21 points of height.
Sprite to High Resolution in 2 colors could be displayed: the color of 
Background (set from the command COLOR) and the color of Main Color of the 
sprite (set with the field [main color] of this command). For Multi-Color 
sprite, two additional colors could be used: Sprite Multi-Color1 and Sprite 
Multi-Color2 (set from the SPRCOL command).  In the programs of the SUPER 
EXPANDER 64 cannot be displayed sprite in the Text Standard mode.  To the 
contrary, in any BitMap graphics mode can be used sprite on High Resolution 
or on Multi-Color, or both.  If the STOP key is pressed or if a condition of 
error stop the program, the SUPER EXPANDER 64 will return automatically in 
the text Standard mode and will extinguish all sprites and the sound.
Here in succession have brought some examples of the SPRITE command:

10 SPRITE 1,1,1,0,0,0,1 REM ACTIVATES SPRITE 1, MAIN COLOR
   WHITE, MULTI-COLOR
20 SPRITE 7,1,7,0,1,1,0 REM ACTIVATES SPRITE 7, MAIN COLOR YELLOW, X AND Y 
   EXPANSION IN HIGH RESOLUTION MODE
30 SPRITE 5, 1 REM EXPANDS SPRITE 5 ON X, ALL OTHER
   CHARACTERISTICS ARE UNAFFECTED

To check which last characteristics have been set for each sprite, use the  
RSPR function.  This function has two topics: a number of sprite and a number 
that represent a parameter position of the SPRITE command.  The syntax for 
the RSPR function is the following:

RSPR (<sprite>,<field>)

The topic <sprite> is a value from 0 to 7 and represent the number of the 
sprite on which information are desired.  The topic <field> is a value from 0 
to 5 that specific which characteristic is being checked.  Each of values of 
the topic <field> for the RSPR function coincides directly to a 
parameter-position on the SPRITE command.  Then, for the number of established
sprite, the RSPR function return the last set of each parameter of the SPRITE 
command.  Follows a chart that show values for the topic <field>, the 
verifyed characteristics, and values that can be returned:

Field	 Characteristic			Returned values

0	 Display Sprite ON/OFF		0= OFF; 1= ON
1	 Main Color of the sprite 	from 0 to 15 (color-code)
2	 Visualization Property		0= High; 1= Low
3	 Sprite expansion on X		0= No; 1= Yes
4	 Sprite expansion on Y		0= No; 1= Yes
5	 Sprite Visualization mode	0= High Resolution
						1= Multi-Color

Here in succession come show two examples of the RSPR function:

10 IF RSPR (5,5)= 1 THEN: SPRITE 5, 2 
20 REM IF SPRITE 5 IS ON MULTI-COLOR MODE, THEN SET ITS 
   MAIN COLOR ON RED 
10 FOR S= 0 TO 7: FOR N= 0 TO 5 
20 PRINT RSPR (S, N);: NEXT N 
30 PRINT: NEXT S
40 REM LINES FROM 10 TO 30 WILL PRINT A LIST OF ALL ACTUAL 
   VALUES OF CHARACTERISTICS OF ALL SPRITES

For exemplifications on the SPRDEF commands, SPRCOL and SPRITE, see the III 
Appendix PROGRAM EXAMPLES.

 
3.3 - MEMORIZATION OF THE SPRITE

As it is possible transfer parts of the screen Bit Map into a variable BASIC 
string (using the command SSHAPE), at the same way can be transferred sprite 
forms in variable string using the command SPRSAV.  SPRSAV can also transfer 
in sprite or from sprite to sprite, contained data in variable string. 
The syntax of the SPRSAV command is the following:

SPRSAV <origin>,<destination>

Each parameter of the SPRSAV command can be a name of variable string or a 
number of sprite.  Additionally, both parameters can be numbers of sprite but 
not strings.  To transfer an image sprite to a string, < origin> will be a 
number of sprite and <destination> a name  string.  Vice versa, to transfer 
the data of a string to a sprite,< origin> will be a name stringh, and 
<destination> a number of sprite.  When both parameters are numbers of sprite,
the sprite <destination> engages the same definition of the sprite <origin> 
(that it stay unaffected).  In this case the resultant appearance of the two 
sprite can not be identical because definitions of their characteristics 
could not be even.   This happens because only the dotted model of the sprite 
<origin> comes copied in the sprite <destination>.  The dotted model of a 
sprite comes memorized line for line, like with the SSHAPE command.  To the 
same way, the last 4 groups of ciphers of the string <destination> contain 
the lengths of the column and of the row.  Formats of the strings create from 
the SSHAPE commands and SPRSAV is identical.  Therefore SPRSAV can be used to 
transfer a sprite in a string, and GSHAPE to bring again the sprite like form 
on the screen Bit Map.
To the same way is possible use SSHAPE to transfer a form from Bit Map to a 
string, and then use SPRSAV to insert the string in a sprite.  When the 
sprite is reformed in this way, need assure to preserve an area of the same 
dimension of the sprite expressed in number of points (24 for 21 points for 
High Resolution, and 12 for 21 for Multi-Color).  Here in succession come 
listed some examples of the SPRSAV command:

SPRSAV 1, A$: REM TRANSFERS THE MODEL DOTTED OF SPRITE 1 TO STRING A$

10 C= 1: D= 4: IF RSPCOL (0)= 2 THEN: SPRSAV C, D
20 REM IF MULTI-COLOR1 OF SPRITE IS RED, TRANSFER THE MODEL 
   DOTTED OF SPRITE 1 TO SPRITE 4


3.4 - ANIMATION OF THE SPRITE

One of most interesting and powerful characteristics of the SUPER EXPANDER 64 
is the capability to install and animate the sprite.  For each sprite, it is 
possible use the MOVSPR command to set the position, move it, stop it.
The syntax of the MOVSPR command is the following:

MOVSPR <number><,X1,Y1>

<number> is the number of the sprite (from 0 to 7) whose position one desire 
set or change.  The coordinate <,X1,Y1> is the new location of the sprite.  
To install a sprite, can sett <,X1, Y1> like absolute values or like relative 
discard.  However, using a relative discard to install a sprite, need be 
awake that the new position comes deliberate from the current position of the 
sprite therefore that from the current location of the CP.  The sprite come 
installed respect their upper left angle.  There is a specific position of 
the screen said "window" in which are observable the sprites.  Coordinates 
that characterize the limits of the screen Bit Map.  For example, the upper 
left angle of the screen Bit Map is (0,0).  To install the upper left angle 
of a sprite they will be (24,50).  The chart of reports (see SCALE) of the 
X-Y coordinates will be used to calculate the absolute coordinates of 
position and the relative distances of movement for the sprite.  To animate a 
sprite and to stop  is been able to use a special form of the parameter 
<,X1,Y1> of the MOVSPR command.  In this case, the parts "X1" and "Y1" of the 
parameter are separate from a sign number (#) instead that from a comma.  
The value "X1" specific in degrees to the direction where the sprite moves an 
angle that go to hourly sense.  The value "Y1" is a number from 0 to 15 and 
specific an abiding velocity of the sprite (where 0 stop the movement of the 
sprite and 15 represent the maximum velocity of it).  The velocity of the 
sprite is measure from the  number of points that the sprite overcomes in a 
certain period of time (in the indicated direction).  The movement of the 
sprite is in reality a series of relative instant discards that the eyes 
recognize like a continual movement.  Is possible simultaneously and 
independently animate one or more sprites to varied velocity and directions.  
When the visualization of a sprite comes deactivated from the SPRITE command, 
its  movement stops automatically.  Once reactivated the command, the movement
will return automatically to the preceding velocity and direction. 
Here some examples of the MOVSPR command:

MOVSPR 1,160,100:		REM PUTS THE UPPER ANGLE
				LEFT OF SPRITE 1 TO CENTER OF THE
				HIGH RESOLUTION SCREEN

MOVSPR 1, +40, 60: 	REM USE THE RELATIVE DISCARD TO
				MOVE SPRITE 1 OF 40 POINTS TO
				RIGHT HAND AND OF 60 TO HIGH

MOVSPR 2,90#8:		REM ANIMATES SPRITE 2 TO AN ANGLE
				OF 90 DEGREES AND TO A VELOCITY OF 8

It is possible to check the position and the velocity of the sprite using the 
RSPPOS function.  This  function has 2 topics: a number of sprite and a 
number that requires the X position, the Y position or  the velocity of the 
sprite.  The syntax of the RSPPOS function is the following:

RSPPOS (<sprite>,<data>)

The topic <sprite> identifies which sprite is being checked. The topic <data> 
specific which information must be returned.  When <data> is 0, it comes 
returned the position current X of the sprite, when <data>  is 1, it comes 
returned the position current Y of the sprite and when <data> is 2, it comes 
returned the current velocity of the sprite expressed in a number from 0 to 
15.

PRUDENCE:	RSPPOS RETURNS ALWAYS coordinates of SCALE 0

Here some examples of the RSPPOS function:

RSPPOS (4,0): REM RETURN CURRENT POSITION
X OF SPRITE 4

RSPPOS (7,1): REM RETURN POSITION CURRENT Y
OF SPRITE 7

10 S= 3: D= 2: PRINT RSPPOS (S, D)
20 REM STAMPS THE VALUE CURRENT OF VELOCITY
   OF SPRITE 3
 

3.5 - MANAGEMENT OF THE BUMPS OF THE SPRITE

The program SUPER EXPANDER 64 gives the capability of map when anybody of 
sprites in movement enters bump with another sprite or with an image of the 
display Bit Map.  It is been able to map the bumps of the sprite using the 
COLINT command and determine which sprite has entered bump using the RBUMP 
function.  All that makes possible create graphic animate display in  BASIC 
program.  The COLINT command characterizes three types of events: bumps among 
sprites, bumps among sprites and images Bit Map and activation of the optic 
pen.  When is verifyed one of these events, the program  finish the line of 
current program and the SUPER EXPANDER 64 transfers the control to the first 
line number of the routine of bumps management.  In other words, the BASIC 
program comes "interrupted" and sells the control to the routine of bump.  
More ahead these events will be characterized like "interrupt of bump."  Once 
performed a RETURN statement in the routine of bump, the control comes 
refunded to the program line  following to the line that had been interrupted.
The syntax of the COLINT command is the following:

COLINT <event>[,line-num] 	can have a value from 0 to 2 and specific which 
					type of event should cause a interrupt of bump.

If <event> is 0, come characterize bumps among sprite and sprite; if <event> 
is 1, come characterize bumps of the sprite with the display Bit Map; and if 
<event> is 2, the activation of the  optic pen causes a "interrupt".
The parameter [,line-num] is the first number of line of the routine in the 
BASIC program where the  control will have transferred when will attend a 
interrupt of bump of the type characterized from <event>.  When the optional 
parameter [,line-num] comes itemized, the sensor of bumps comes set to ON 
(activated) for the datum type of <event>.  When the indicator[,line-num] is 
omitted, the sensor of bumps comes set to OFF (deactivated) for itemized type 
of <event>.  A bump among sprite and sprite attend when a part of a sprite 
that is not of the same color of the Background deals with the same position 
of a part of another sprite with a different color from the Background too.  
A sprite cannot cause a interrupt of bump when it is completely outside 
screen (not observable). There is bump between sprite and Bit Map when a part 
of a sprite that not be of the same of the Background cover the same position 
of a part (also it with color diverged from the Background) of an image on 
the screen (for example  Main Color, Multi-Color1 or Multi-Color2).  Sprites 
that have been deactivated using the SPRITE command, don't cause interrupt of 
bump.
Here some examples of the COLINT statement:

50 COLINT 0,500: REM BEGINS TO MAP BUMPS BETWEEN SPRITE AND SPRITE

60 COLINT 1,600: REM BEGINS TO MAP BUMPS BETWEEN SPRITE AND BIT MAP

500 COLINT: COLINT 1: REM DEACTIVATE BUMPS BETWEEN SPRITE AND SPRITE AND  
    BETWEEN SPRITE AND BIT MAP

In the preceding examples the line 50 causes the transfer of the control to a 
routine to the line 500 when is verifyed a bump between sprite and sprite.  
To the same way, the line 60 arouses a transfer of control to a routine to 
the line 600 when come pronounced a bump between sprite and Bit Map.  In the 
line 500, the mapping of subsequent bumps between sprite comes deactivated 
during the management of the current bump.  You can set one/all types of 
mapping of <event> active to the same time, but only one bump for time can be 
managed.  Therefore would always need deactivate subsequent mappings of bump 
like first footstep in the routines of management of the bumps.  This 
prevents that they attend other interrupt during the management of that 
current.  Finally, the last footstep to perform in the routine of interrupt 
of bump, it is that to reactivate the sensor of bumps.  To characterize the 
sprite that have entered bump, the RBUMP function can be used.  This function 
informs on which sprite has entered bump with other sprite, or on which 
sprite has entered bump with the display Bit Map.  It is not necessary that 
interrupts of bump are activated to use RBUMP.  
The syntax of the RBUMP function is:

RBUMP (<event>)

The RBUMP topic coincides directly to the type of <event> of the COLINT 
command.  If <event> is 0, the RBUMP function informs on the bumps between 
sprite and sprite.  If <event> is 1,  RBUMP informs on which sprite has 
entered bump with the display Bit Map.  In each of the preceding cases, RBUMP 
returns a number from 0 to 255. The position of bit (from 0 to 7) in the 
number returned from RBUMP coincides to the sprite number from 0 to 7. When a 
bit comes set to ON  (value 1), the sprite in that bit position had involved 
in a bump. When is audited contemporaneously more bumps, you will need use 
the RSPPOS function, mentioned in precedence, to determine which sprite has 
entered bump and with which objects.  The RBUMP function reads the registers 
hardware of bump sprite in the control chip video of the Commodore 64.  
These registers are reset automatically each time they come read, also when 
you use the RBUMP function or the PEEK function for read them directly.  
Therefore, you must become  reference to the information returned from RBUMP 
more of a time, the value will be allotted to a name of variable.  Here an 
example of the RBUMP function:

1000 A= RBUMP (0): B= RBUMP (1)
1010 REM LINE 1000 READ BUMPS BETWEEN SPRITE AND SPRITE 
     AND THOSE BETWEEN SPRITE AND BIT MAP

In the following example, the line 530 uses the operator logical AND to 
check if the sprite 1 is  entered in bump or not.

500 MOVSPR 1,160,100: REM PUTS SPRITE 1 TO CENTER
    OF THE SCREEN
510 FOR X= 1 TO 50: REM PLAY A LOOP 50 TIMES
520 MOVSPR 1, +5, +5: REM MOVES 5 POINTS TO RIGHT AND 5 POINTS TO DAWN
530 IF RBUMP (0) AND 2 THEN GOSUB 800
540 REM WHEN SPRITE 1 ENTERS BUMP PLAY 
    THE ROUTINE AT LINE 800
550 NEXT X: REM FINISHES THE LOOP

For examples of the SPRSAV commands, MOVSPR and COLINT, see the photos on the 
rear of this handbook and the III Appendix PROGRAM EXAMPLES.



- 4 -  GAMES COMMANDS AND KEYS FUNCTION

Input/Output of the Game Ports.
Keys Programmable Function.


4.1 - INPUT/OUTPUT OF THE GAME PORTS

The SUPER EXPANDER 64 furnishes three functions that allow to read the 
Positions easily of one or two jovsticks (cloche of command), up to four 
paddles for games or coordinates of the optic pen from the game ports of the 
Commodore 64, that is the RJOY function for the joystick, RPOT for paddles 
and RPEN for the optic pen.  
The syntax for the RJOY function is:

RJOY (<joystick>)

The topic <joystick> can have the value of 1 or 2 and specific which 
joysticks in reading is connected to the Control Port 1 or to the Control 
Port 2. A number delayed from RJOY points out toward which direction has been 
pressed the jovstick.  When comes pressed the key "fire" in the joystick, a 
value of 128 comes added to the directional value of the returned number.  
The illustration  that follows shows values that coincide to each of 
directions of the joystick:

KEY "FIRE"
			1
		8		2
	7		0		3
		6		4
			5

  Values of the Direction of the Joystick

Here in succession, some examples of the RJOY function.

Consult the III Appendix, PROGRAM EXAMPLES for a program that illustrate 
better the use of the RJOY function.

10 D= RJOY (1): IF D< 127 THEN GOSUB 750 
20 REM IF FIRE KEY OF THE JOYSTICK IS PRESSED, PLAY THE 
   SUBROUTINE AT LINE 750

The topic <data> can engage the value of 0 or 1 and specific which of the 
coordinates respectively  X or Y, of the optic pen comes returned.  The 
returned RPEN values can change from a system to the other.  Like result the 
X position comes returned like an equal number, and varied approximately from 
60 to 380, and the Y position varied approximately from 50 to 250.  The value 
0 has returned from RPEN when the optic pen is not on the screen and no 
interrupt has been activated from the last reading.  A white background of 
the screen (or very bright) usually is required to beseech the optic pen. 
Note that only the Control Port 1 is able to read a optic pen. Here an 
example of the RPEN function:

50 X= RPEN (0): Y= RPEN (1)
60 REM LINE 50 READS COORDINATE X AND Y OF THE OPTIC PEN
70 IF X= 0 AND Y= 0 THEN 50
80 REM PLAYED A LOOP IF THE OPTIC PEN IS DEACTIVATED
90 SPRITE 7,0: REM DEACTIVATES SPRITE 7 IF THE OPTIC PEN IS ACTIVATED



50 D= RJOY (2): REM READS DIRECTION JOYSTICK 24 
60 IF D= 6 THEN X+ X-1: Y+1: GOTO 50
70 REM IF JOYSTICK COMES PRESSED TOWARD LEFT HAND AND TOWARD DOWN  
   REGULATE THE X-Y COORDINATE IN CONSEQUENCE.

Using the RPOT function, the current position of a maximum of four paddles 
can be read for games.  Paddles 0 and 1 come read from the Control Port 1 and 
paddles 2 and 3 from the Control Port 2. The syntax for the RPOT function is 
the following:

RPOT (<paddle>)

The topic <paddle> can engage a value from 0 or 3 and specific which paddle 
will come read.  The RPOT function delays a number from 0 to 255, that point 
out the position of the handle of control on the paddle.  When the button 
"fire" is pressed, a value of 256 comes added to this number.  In this way, 
when the value delayed from RPOT is bigger than 255, the key fire results 
pressed.  Follows an example of the RPOT function.  Consult the Appendix III 
PROGRAM EXAMPLES for an illustration of the use of the RPOT function in a 
animation game.

800 X= RPOT (0): Y= RPOT (1)
810 REM LINE 800 READS THE PADDLE ON CONTROL PORT 1
820 IF X> 255 OR Y> 255 THEN GOSUB 1000
830 REM LINE 820 CHECKS IF FIRE BUTTONS ARE PRESSED AND 
    PLAYS THE SUBROUTINE AT LINE 1000 IF THE RESULT IS POSITIVE
840 MOVSPR 4, X, Y: REM ADJOURN POSITION OF THE SPRITE
850 GOTO 800

The RPEN function reveals the value of the X or Y coordinates of the optic 
pen to it last activation.  To use the RPEN function, must not be activated 
the function of the interrupt of bump.  Coordinates delay from RPEN always 
use the system of coordinates standard SCALE 0. The syntax for the RPEN 
function is:

RPEN (<data>)


4.2 - KEYS PROGRAMMABLE FUNCTION

The SUPER EXPANDER 64 allows to use the capabilities of the keys function 
programs them according to the demands of the consumer for the BASIC programs 
personnels.  Programming function keys with commands frequently used is 
spared time and work and they are avoided the errors. The SUPER EXPANDER 64 
at the start gives the following definitions for the eight keys function:

	f1= "GRAPHIC"	f5= "RUN"
	f2= "SAVE"		f6= "CIRCLE"
	f3= "SPRDEF"	f7= "LIST"
	f4= "LOAD"		f8= "SPRITE"

The KEY command can be used to program keys function or to check their 
meanings current. The syntax of the KEY command is:

KEY [<[keynum,exp-string>]

The KEY command used without parameters will perform a LIST of the current 
definitions of the keys function  (output on peripheral number 3).  The CMD 
command can be used to redirect output in other devices like for example the 
printer or the unity disk.  When are present parameters [<keynum,exp-string>],
the key function itemized from <keynum> will be redefined. The value of 
<keynum> can change from 1 to 8.  <,exp-string> can be a alphabetical string 
among quote ("string"), a variable name of BASIC string, or an expression of 
string formed from a connection (union of strings) using the operator"+". 
Also all the terms of the expression must be strings.  After have programmed 
the keys function, they can be used in the Direct mode or from Program.  In 
the direct mode, the string that has been programmed for that key will have 
brought to Text Standard screen mode (this cannot be observable in the 
graphic Bit Map mode).  Then, pressing the RETURN key, the string comes 
performed like a direct command (or series of separate commands from the two 
points":"). If the last character of the string is a RETURN (CHR$ (13)), will 
be pressed easily the key function to perform its relative commands.  In the 
Program mode, will be used the function key in answered the INPUT or GET 
commands to fill the variables string in programs.  For the INPUT command, 
pressing a key function, its current definition is displayed immediately after
the prompt of the INPUT command constituted from a question mark (?).  
When is pressed RETURN, the string comes transferred to the variable of the 
INPUT command.  Like in precedence, if the last character of the string is a 
RETURN (CHR$ (13)), will be sufficient press the key function to transfer the 
string of the key function to the variable.  The maximum length of the string 
combined for all definitions of the Keys Function is of 255 characters, 
generally this number of characters is more sufficient for all the practical 
purposes, in as usually long sequences of command for the Keys are not 
programmed Function.  To deactivate one or more Keys Programmable Function, 
will be used the function CHR$ (n) to bring again each text to his original 
value.  These will be the values of the characters returned from the GET 
command on the systems not fitted with the SUPER EXPANDER 64.  For example, 
to deactivate the key f1, you will need itemize KEY 1, CHR$ (133).  Here there
is a short program to use or alter the setting of definitions of Keys 
Function:

10 KEY l, "RUN"+ CHR$ (13)
20 KEY 2, "SAVE"+ CHR$ (34)+ "VSPX.1"+ CHR$ (34)+," 8"+ CHR$ (13)
30 KEY 3, "SAVE"+ CHR$ (34)+ "VSPX.1"+ CHR$ (34)+," 8"+ CHR$ (13) 
40 KEY 4, "X= 100: Y= 80: GOTO 1000"+ CHR$ (13) 
50 KEY 5, "COLOR 1,1l"+ CHR$ (13) 
60 KEY 6, "CIRCLE"
70 KEY 7, "LIST"+ CHR$ (13) 
80 KEY 8, "KEY"+ CHR$ (13)

Additionally to as itemized in the preceding strings of Keys Function, they 
will also be used characters of control to characterize as it follows:

 	Selection of the color
 	Movements of the cursor
 	Video to inverted field and
 	Musical strings

Definition of the Sound Effects.
Execution of the sound effects.


5.1 - DEFINITION OF THE SOUND EFFECTS

The SUPER EXPANDER 64 allows to use easily the Sound lnterface Device chip 
(SID) of the Commodore 64 to create music and sound effects for games.  The 
musical staircase that the SUPER EXPANDER 64 use is near to a tuning from 
concert (where the F in 4 octave has a frequency of 440 Hz).  Comes furnished 
commands to determine the characteristics of the sounds to create.  
Additionally, it will be played in Direct mode and also in Program mode.  
For more greater details, consult the Manual of the Programmer of the 
Commodore 64.  The command TIME comes used to determine the velocity to which 
the music will come ring.  The command TUNE for the forms of wave and the 
"envelopes" of the sounds.  The FILTER command to create effects  of 
resonance and to increase or disband definite rubbers of frequency in the 
sounds.
The syntax of the command TIME is:

TIME <velocity>

The parameter <pace> checks the relative duration of the notes while rings 
come.  The value of <velocity> can change from 0 to 255.  To the value 0, 
the notes will play forever.  With the increase of the value <velocity>, the 
duration of the notes decreases.  The beginning value of TIME comes 
established to 8.  The real duration of the complete note across the formula 
in seconds can be calculated (duration= 19.22/<velocity>).  Here some 
examples of TIME:

10 TIME 180: REM SOUNDS WITH A FAST TIME
   ARE PROPER FOR GAMES
20 TIME 6: REM FOR MUSIC OF SLOW ROOM

The syntax for the TUNE command is:

TUNE <env>,[,[att][,[dec][,[sus][,[rel][,[form][,amplitude]]]]]]

The parameter <env> specifics the number of envelope of TUNE and can have a 
value from 0 to 9. Parameters [att], [dec], [sus], and [rel] can have a value 
from 0 to 15 and they come used to characterize the characteristics Attack, 
Decay, Sustain, and Release (ADSR) of the envelope of the wave form.  Attack 
is the time during which the sound pass from the minimum volume to the 
maximum.  Decay is the time that the sound employs to pass from the maximum 
volume to the level of sustain.  Sustain is the level of volume to which the 
note will be liable for best part of his duration.  Release is the time that 
the sound employs to pass from Sustain level to zero.  The parameter [ form] 
specific the form of wave of the sound and can have a value from 0 to 4.  
Following are showed the values of the parameter [form] and their 
correspondent forms of wave:

Values	Forms of wave
0		Triangle
1		Tooth of Saw
2		Impulse
3		White Noise
4		Ring Modulation

The parameter [amplitude] has a meaning only when the form of select wave is 
"impulse".  This parameter can have a value from 0 to 4095.  An amplitude of 
2048 causes a quadrate wave.  The SUPER EXPANDER 64 allows to characterize up 
to 10 envelopes TUNE.  These comes set on the beginning values like listed in 
the following chart:

     Env   Att   Dec   Sus   Rel   Form  Ampli  Tool
	0	0	9	0	0	2	1536	Piano
	1	12	0	12	0	1		Accordion
	2	0	0	15	0	0		Calliope
	3	0	5	5	0	3		Drum
	4	9	4	4	0	0		Flute
	5	0	9	2	1	1		Guitar
	6	0	9	0	0	2	512	Clavicembalo
	7	0	9	9	0	2	2048	Organ
	8	8	9	4	1	2	512	Trumpet
	9	0	9	0	0	0		Xylophone

Here some examples of the TUNE command:

40 TUNE 0, 1280: REM CHANGES AMPLITUDE OF THE IMPULSE
   FOR THE ENVELOPE OF PIANO
50 TUNE 4,12,6,6: REM INCREASES VALUES OF ATTACK AND DECAY TO SUPPORT 
   THE ENVELOPE OF FLUTE

The FILTER command comes used to Change dinamically other tonal quality of 
the caused sound.  You can do it regulating a filter of wave to disband the 
ranges of frequency choices.  Also you will be able to itemize an effect of 
resonance that emphasizes the notes with near frequencies to those of 
clipping of the filter.  The syntax of the FILTER command is:

FILTER [[freq][,[low][,[band][,[high][,reso]]]]

The parameter [[freq] is the frequency of clipping for the filter in the SID 
chip and his value can change from 0 to 2048.  To determine the real 
frequency of clipping in Hz, you will need multiply this value for 5.8 and 
add 30.  Parameters [low], [band] and [high] come used together to determine 
which parts of the audio spectrum must pass unaffected to the output of the 
SID chip, and which parts must be express from the filter.  Each of these 
parameters can have a value from 0 (cancel) to 1 (passage).  They will be 
able to set one or more of these parameters on one of the two values.  The 
parameter [reso] can change from 0 to 15 it determines the resonance (for 
example how come emphasized the maximum effect of the sounds in proximity of 
the frequency of clipping).
Here some examples of the FILTER command:

10 FILTER 2048, 1		Imposes the cut mode of the filter and pass high 
				filter
30 FILTER 1024, 10	Imposes the control of the resonance
70 FILTER 700,1,0,1	Imposes the filter for a formality "notch reject" to 
				disband sounds  more near to the frequency of 
				clipping choice


5.2 - EXECUTION OF THE SOUND EFFECTS

With the SUPER EXPANDER 64 the music comes compost using string characters.  
Will be performed music inserting these characters from keyboard in direct 
mode, or includes them in PRINT string of the program.  Notes come itemize 
with letters from A to G (from La to Sol).  The duration comes indicated from 
letters W (whole), H (half), Q (quarter), I (eighth), and S (sixteenth).  
Each note that follows one of the letters of duration comes play to the same 
length until the same duration doesn't come changed. The letter R specifics 
a break of the duration of a note.  The notes preceded with "#" sign will be 
played like sharp and notes preceded with "$" will be played like flat.  
The notes preceded from a "." will be played like pointed notes, one time and 
half of the normal duration.  Here one scheme that abridges these musical 
elements:

Element			Description
A, B, C, D, E, F, G	Notes
#				Sharp (preced the note)
$				Flat (preced the note)
.				Pointed (preced the note)
W				Whole
H				Half
Q				Fourth
I				Eighth
S				Sixteenth
R				Break (of duration of a note)

To the same way, letters come used to characterize some values of control of 
the SID chip.  The control of the principal volume will be inserted using the 
U letter follows from a number from 0 to 9.  The TUNE envelope comes select 
from the T letter, follows from a number from 0 to 9. These values  coincide 
to the envelope numbers as like established from the TUNE command.  One or 
more of the three voices of the SID chip can be activate on the same time.  
The V letter followed from a number from 0 to 2 will choose which voices will 
perform the music.  The filter of the SID chip comes set to ON from "X1" and 
to OFF from "X0".  There is only a filter, so its setting bias all the 
activate voices.  A distinctive octave for a note comes choice from the 
letter "O" followed from a number from 0 to 6. The character <CTRL-F> comes 
used to activate or deactivate the sound.
Here one scheme that abridges values of control of the SID:



Check SID	Description
U		Volume (0-9)
T		TUNE envelope (0-9)
V		Voice (0-2)
X		FILTER (0=OFF, 1=ON)
O		Octave (0-6)
< CTRL-F>	Activate/ Deactivate the musical breeding (CHR$(6))

The initial default values for the musical parameters are:
TUNE 0, Voice 0, Octave 4, Volume 9, Filter 0 (OFF) and Whole duration of the 
notes.  Like for other expect of the SUPER EXPANDER 64, once that have been 
established a value for an musical element, that value becomes the new 
default for following operations.
Here an example of musical strings:

10 PRINT "PLAYING HALF NOTES< CTRL-F> HCDEFGAB< CTRL-F> AND NOW 
   SIXTEENTH..."
20 PRINT CHR$ (6); "SCDEFGAB"

And now, you insert this program and it will result a "Boogie" !

1 POKE53280,0: POKE53281,0: PRINT CHR$ (147)
10 FILTER 1200,10,1,0,1,9: TIME 13

I  Appendix - NOTES FOR PROGRAMMING

In this bureau will be furnished subsequent information on the use of the 
SUPER EXPANDER 64.  You will find important notes on the followings topics:

 	How comes Used the Memory.

 	Graphic Bit Map Visualizations.

 	Sprite and lnterrupt of Bump.

 	I/O and Management of Errors.


HOW COMES USED THE MEMORY

The program SUPER EXPANDER 64 is a auto-playing cartridge that resides in the 
memory to $8000-$9FFF (exadecimal) or 32768-40959 (decimal). The available 
space for BASIC programs comes reduced of 8192 byte.  The SUPER EXPANDER 64 
uses the RAM memory to $COOO-$CBFF and  (49152-52223).  Albeit the rest of 
the memory up to $CFFF (53247) doesn't come for the moment used, it comes 
preserved for possible future expansions of the systed software.  The program 
SUPER EXPANDER 64 also uses the RAM memory that exists "under" of it and the  
BASIC ROM language to $8000-$BFFF.  This memory comes used for visualizations 
on the screen, sprite models, programmable definitions of character, etc. The 
POKE command will be used to change the contents of this RAM memory, but a 
PEEK function will return the contents of the ROM memory.  Here one scheme 
that abridges the use, from the SUPER EXPANDER 64, of the RAM memory in these 
areas:

Addr.Exad.  Decimal 	Description
$8000		32768		Stack area of coordinates for PAINT
$8A00		35328		Memory for sprites (8 sprites)
$8C00		35840		RAM checks of color for visualization Bit Map
$9000		36864		ROM character generator (up to $9FFF)
$AOOO		40960		Screen Bit Map (up to $BFFF)
$COOO		49152		Impermanent memorization of data and areas of work
$C400		50176		RAM for programmable characters (used from CHAR and 
				from the Text Split Screen)
$CCOO		52224		Booked to the expansion (up to $CFFF)

A program of 2084 byte used to control the Commodore interface IEEE-488 comes 
usually saved in the RAM memory beginning from $C000.  During the 
initialization of the system, the SUPER EXPANDER 64, when map the presence of 
this device, moves automatically the IEEE-488 program to $7800 (30720).   
This reduces  the quantity of free space for programs (-2048 bytes).


GRAPHIC BIT MAP VISUALIZATIONS

When the PRINT command in the Multi-Color GRAPHIC mode is used, is impossible 
prevent that the Screen Editor adjourns the RAM of control color.  Of 
consequence, if you finger to the inland of the text screen, behind to the 
visualization Bit Map, a change of some colors will be verifyed.  The 
resultant effect will be that images display in the Multi-Color2 will become 
of Main Color.  In the GRAPHIC 2 and 3 mode (High Resolution and Split Screen)
lines come drawed wth a width of a point.  You will be passed from this to 
the lines in black using the POKE command.  POKE 49168,0 set lines to a width 
of a point, and POKE 49168,1 lines to a width of 2 points.  In the Split 
Screen mode, the cursor will be observable only in the last 5 lines of the 
screen.  Using the  HOME or CRSR key the controls will bring the cursor 
behind the part of the screen Bit Map, where "you loses it of sight" until 
you move cursor toward the lower part with keys of cursor control.
The SSHAPE commands and SPRSAV transfer forms to strings line for line. 4 
bytes containers the length of the column (X) and of the row (Y) of the form 
is assistants to the string.  The first two bytes constitutes the number of 
the positions -X minus one, and the last two bytes constitute the number of 
positions -Y minus one.  Both numbers come decided like "pointers of address"
to 16-bit in formed [low-byte], [high-byte].


SPRITE AND INTERRUPT OF BUMP

When the Main Color of a sprite is even to  the color of Background of the 
Bit Map screen, the sprite will result invisible.  However, if the sprite is 
activated, it will cause still interrupt of bump with other sprite and with 
the Bit Map visualizations.  Can be only eight definitions of active sprite 
at the same time, you can define more sprite saving definitions in strings.
When you animate a sprite, the velocity parameter of MOVSPR comes used like 
the real number of positions point of which the sprite stirs in each break of 
time.  In other words, the movement is corporate from a series of "instant" 
re-location. Therefore, a sprite that stirs to high velocity could not enter 
bump with a line or a thin form, or with an other small sprite simply 
"jumping" over of them.


I/O AND MANAGEMENT OF ERRORS

During the visualization of sprites, the SUPER EXPANDER 64 modify some 
pointers of address employed for the treatment of systems interrupt.  Then, 
before effect an I/O operation from a cassette, it is necessary deactivate 
all sprites to restore the normal treatment of system interrupts.  The SUPER 
EXPANDER 64 beeps errors of command by BASIC interpreter, and in this way 
doesn't add own error messages.  Instead, an improper expression of syntax 
arouses a message "SINTAX ERROR" and a value parameter external to the 
anticipated range represents a  "ILLEGAL QUANTITY" issing parameters or 
topics comes beeped from a message of error "OUT OF DATE".  If the command 
"PAINT" exhausts the space of the coordinates stack, will result a message of 
error "FORMULA TOO COMPLEX".  If a BASIC program comes halted pressing the 
STOP key, or if the BASIC halts the program on a condition of error, the 
SUPER EXPANDER 64 will select automatically the standard text mode and will 
deactivate sprites.  Use the MOVSPR command to reset the velocity, or press 
the STOP/RESTORE keys to halt the movement of sprites.  Selections of color 
and the data of visualization Bit Map stay unchanged.  If a program finishes 
with an END statement or STOP, the  text mode doesn't come select 
automatically.  Pressing the STOP key, the PAINT command or the playing of a 
musical sequence or the sketch of  a line won't come interrupted.  The 
RUN/STOP and RESTORE keys restore the SUPER EXPANDER 64 on all his inchoate 
values of default, to exception of the definitions of Key Function.  Typeing 
the CONT command to resume a program formerly halted, this won't return to 
the designated graphic mode, and will not take back the playing of music, the 
movement of sprites or mapping of bumps.
